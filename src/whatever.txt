[(x0,y0),(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3)]

x0 = 2
y0 = 4

x1 = 8
y1 = 10

x2 = 14
y2 = 16

x3 = 20
y3 = 22

Those are the indeces of the data that we need.

[(x,y) | x <- coordsList !! [2,8,14,20], y <- coordsList !! _ <- [4,10,16,22]]

return each element in a list:

[ x | x <- y, y 


func :: [Int] -> Int -> Int
	f [] b = []
	f a b = 

1) Say y = [(x0,y0),(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3)]
2) Get each x element in y by doing y !! _ <- [2,8,14,20]
